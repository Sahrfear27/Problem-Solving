Javascript is a dynamically typed language which mean the type of the variable is determined 
at run time.
The type is determined when the code runs, not when it is written.
let data = "Hello"; // Initially a string
data = 42;          // Now a number
This gives flexibility but also gives the  chances to run time error.
function add(a,b){
    return a+b
}
console.log(add((2,3))) //5
console.log(add(("2", "3"))) // "23" which return an unexpected behavior.

TypeScript is statically typed which means the type of the data is determined at compile time and not at run time
function add(a:number, b:numer){
    return  a +b
} 
console.log(add(2,3)) //5
console.log(add("2","3")) // Error: Argument of type string is not assignable to parameter of type number
Importance of TypeScript: It catches the potential error during development reducing run time bugs.




Object:An object is a collection of name/value pairs. Almost everthing in Javascript is an object. 
Object encapsulate state management in properties and associate behavior in methods.
Example: a car, which has properties like color, weight.. etc, and actions like honk(), move().. etc
Example of object in javaascript: array, Date, error
